# Sorting algorithms comparison

## About
A project that shows the differences between some sortings algorithms. The algorithms are tested on different inputs and the comparison is based on the execution time.

The algorithms and their complexities are:
1. **Merge Sort**: O(n logn)
2. **Radix Sort**: O(d (n + b)), where b = base and d = number of digits of the maximum number
3. **Shell Sort**: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
4. **Counting Sort**: O(n + k), where k=the maximum number
5. **Heap Sort**: O(n logn)
